## The premise

People are afraid to think.

So they don't. Rather than coming up with their own ideas, they copy someone else's, without apply any judgement in choosing what to copy and why. It is as if they were just going through the motions. Doing what's expected of them, without stopping to think where these supposed expectations are coming from.


premise
  people are afraid to think
  so they take someone elses thoughts instead
  because its easier to offload the blame
  because its proven
  because they are lazy

examples
  the way people set up their lives: study, get a job, get married, have kids
  the way people set up their relationships: gender roles, money, cheating
  the way people architect their systems
  the way people structure their organizations
  the way people decide goals
  the way people structure their applications
  the way people run their projects

obvious problems
  some of the examples you take are shit examples
  or maybe they were acceptable, even good, within a completely different context
  some examples you take are good, but they are designed for a very specific kind of problem which is not your problem
  you're picking a solution based off reputation, without really understanding your problem

think
  so, think
  it's not that hard

  think about your situation
  understand your problem
  understand what's generic about it, and what's unique about it
  understand what you're trying to do, what you're trying to get out of it

  by all means, look at how others are solving or addressing similar/related/adjacent problems
  but do so looking for inspiration, not looking for an already-made solution
  understand how others have failed before, and why

  think about how success looks like. how will you know that your problem is solved? what should you measure?
  is it an all-or-nothing situation, or can you track partial progress

  with all of this, go and design the solution that makes sense for you
  try shit out. if it doesn't work, think why it failed and try something different
