This was the first CD that I ever bought.

As an awkward geeky teenager, I'd say it's impossible not to relate to [Max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo18VIoR2xU). The fact that I've had migraines since I was a kid definitely did not help.

But this rec is not about the movie, it's about its soundtrack. Just take a look at [the track list](https://www.discogs.com/master/60010-Various-%CF%80-Music-For-The-Motion-Picture). This is how I found out about [Aphex Twin](https://aphextwin.warp.net/) and [Autechre](https://www.autechre.ws/). This how I discovered [Roni Size](https://ronisize.co.uk/) and [Drum and bass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_and_bass) in general. Yes, the rest of the album is great, don't feel sad I did not call your specific artist out, geez.
