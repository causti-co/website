I first saw this show as a teenager. It was airing in the [local anime channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotion_(TV_channel)), as part of their western adult-focused content.
And it was a Spanish dub. The humor was peculiar, the animation style was unique. I liked it, but did not think much of it.

It was when rediscovering it a few years later than I realized the genius of this show: It's just all a great excuse to have comedians come in and do a few minutes of material, as-is.
The therapy setting makes it just work. And these were not just random comedians. You had [Ron Lynch](https://www.ronlynch1.com/), [Sarah Silverman](https://sarahsilvermanmerch.com/), [Jake Johannsen](https://www.jakethis.com/), [Judy Tenuta](https://www.judytenuta.com/), [Louis CK](https://louisck.com/), [David Cross](https://officialdavidcross.com/), and the list [just keeps going](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dr._Katz,_Professional_Therapist_episodes).

I'm linking to Jonathan's website, you can find the show on DVD and [online](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3H6z037pboGUWNoRht95JX5Vo15ZKtFb) as well. Please **do not** watch the "HD" version, it's an AI upscale that completely destroys the original animation style.
