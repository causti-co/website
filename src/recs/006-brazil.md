[Terry Gilliam](http://terrygilliamweb.com/) is responsible for two of the movies that I can just keep watching over and over again, and Brazil is one of them.

An anachronistically modern horror movie, where bureaucracy is the monster, and it cannot be defeated. Do you have the right form? Is it stamped? Every nail we take from your fingers is costing the Government money. You will be invoiced. Think of your credit.

Don't worry. It's just a movie. This is not real.
