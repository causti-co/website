There's this playlist that I keep open in my browser. It's been open for at least 10 years. Every time it gets to the end, I go back to the beginning and start listening again.

What's in the playlist? 440+ hours of audio, consisting of every time [Patrice O'Neal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_O%27Neal) was a guest on [The Opie & Anthony radio show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opie_and_Anthony). It's one thing to listen to a stand-up comedian while they are doing a special, or an interview at a late-night show. But it's something completely different when you get to listen to them just talk shit with their friends. Sure, now that everybody and their mother has a podcast this is not as unique, but you need to put yourself 20 years back in time, when this stuff was going on (the first episodes with Patrice are from 2002). And this was not just Patrice, but rather the entire [Comedy Cellar](https://www.comedycellar.com/) crowd: [Jimmy Norton](https://www.jimnorton.com/) (3rd mic on O&A), [Bob Kelly](https://robertkellylive.com/), [Rich Vos](https://www.richvos.com/), [Bill Burr](https://billburr.com/), [Nick Di Paolo](https://www.nickdip.com/), [Colin Quinn](https://colinquinn.com/), [Louis CK](https://louisck.com/).
